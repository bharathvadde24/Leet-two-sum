Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

 

Constraints:

    2 <= nums.length <= 104
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    -109 <= target <= 109
    Only one valid answer exists.

 
Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

Hint 1
A really brute force way would be to search for all possible pairs of numbers but that would be too slow. Again, it's best to try out brute force solutions for just for completeness. It is from these brute force solutions that you can come up with optimizations.
Hint 2
So, if we fix one of the numbers, say x, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number y which is value - x where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster?
Hint 3
The second train of thought is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?

Hello all,

I'm new coding and noob in using classes. why no one is writing int main() in their codes. Definetly there will be different versions in the main() i.e taking input from STDIN, passing arguments to class etc.

In interview, I was asked what if duplicates exists.. How do we handle this?
My original thought is worst case nums = [1,1,1,1] target is 2
then the complexity if N^2... Is it true?
Is there any way to improve this?

Way 1 --> Brute force -->O(n2)
simply check if ith element is making a pair with any of the other element on
the right side

Way 2-->Using Two Pointer approach-->O(n log n )
time complexity is nlogn because in this approach, the array will be first sorted and then , two pointer approach will be used

Way 3-->Using HashMap -->O(n)
keep on storing the elements that we reach , also keep on check if target-element is already present in the hashmap or not , if it is , then we found a pair

Can't find a better place to ask this...
Every time I passed a problem, it's marked with a green check mark.
If I want to redo all the problems for the second round, is there a way to "reset" all the marks?

We can see a lot of HashMap solutions using a HashMap to store the number as the key and the index as the value.

Many people will come up the same questions that what if there have duplicate numbers in the array?

Well, it's not a problem at all. Because in the description, it says there is exactly one solution. I will prove it here:

    Say we have three N1 in the array like this [N1, N2, N1, N3, N1], then N1 will not be part of the result with N2 or N3, since if N1 is part of the result, then we have three solutions which go against the description. N1 cannot be part of result with itself neither since then we have three solutions again. So in this case, we do not care duplicates at all.

    So the only possible situation that the N1 can be the result is: N1 MUST only have two of them, and the target MUST be 2 * N1, then we have an array like this: [N1, N2, N1], and a target like this 2 * N1. In this case, after building up the map, N1's index will be the right most one which is 2. Then when we start from the first N1 at index 0, we do (target - N1) and get N1, and then query the N1's index in the array, which is 2, and then we can get the result which is [0, 2] with no problem.

O(n^2) I got Time Limit Exceed. Does anyone got accept by O(n^2) ? I just use binary search and finally accept.

Sorry for the newbie question: is there any way to read the test cases for a given problem? Even after having validated it, I couldn't find how to access them.

PS: At the moment of posting this general question, I realize I need to assign it a particular problem as a category. So I guess this is the wrong place to ask. Could you redirect me to some "meta" forum?

Hello there. This is my first time solving problems on leetcode and I ran into a problem. The output of my code is [0, 1], and the output expected is [0,1]. But yet, site says im wrong. Also I see my output in "stdout", not in the "Output" line. I used "print()" method for output. How should I do it instead? image

I want to use bitset in C++. So the time complexity is O(n). However, I failed to include. The compile error is "Line 7: 'bitset' was not declared in this scope".

So, are there any other way to solve this problem and the complexity is O(n);
